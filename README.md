This repository demonstrates a common Python coding error: a ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains code that calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, it fails to handle the case where the input list is empty, leading to a division by zero. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles the empty list scenario, preventing the error.
